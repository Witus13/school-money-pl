# School Money project
! This project's language is Polish.

It's just one of my school projects made with Polymer 1.7, 
with many parts from @Polymer and @PolymerElements  
All images come from Google Search for those people and are edited in LunaPic.  
Card flip from Supercharged.

## What is it about?
It's an really little app that renders a bank-note based on provided conditions and controls.

## Status
Done! You can now go and play with it! 
This project is not going to receive any further updates after reaching the finished state

# Warning
Project is made for Chrome and due to some lack of compatybility with `flexbox` + `position: absolute` on other browser this might not render fully correctly.

# Play with it
